# python variables
# 1. static type variables (int age; age must be integer)
# 2. dynamic type variables (x = 10; x can change data type when assign or override)

# variables are case_sensitive
Age = 30
age = 23

print("Age is ", Age, end="\n")
print("age is ", age)

# variables naming rules
# 1. can't start with number
# 23age = 23 # error

# 2. can't start with special characters
# @age = 23 # error

# 3. can't use space between variable name
# city name = "Yangon" # error

# 4. can start with underscore
_color = "red"
print(_color)

# 5. can start with Uppercase and lowercase characters
Fullname = "Mr. Tom"
city = "New York"

print(Fullname," lives in ", city)
